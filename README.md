# C-Sharp-and-.NET-Projects
Repository created to hold coursework completed during the C# and .NET course.

Introduction:
	The coursework stored in this repository are the result of completed coursework for the C# and .NET course.  Through the duration of this course, I have utilized the concepts and material to successfully complete various assignments, challenges, and projects.
Tech:
	-Language(s) & Modules Used: C#, .NET Frameworks, .NET Core, System.IO, Entity Framework
	-IDE: Visual Studios 2019
	-Chrome Web Browser

Assignments & Projects:
	-Car Insurance Project: This project sucessfully demonstrates the use of using an ASP.NET MVC Framework to create an application that collects user input, puts that input into a database,
		and allows that data to be edited and able to be deleted.  The focus of this project was for me to impliment methods that allowed for calculation of a monthly cost that was determiend
		by the user input.  The montly cost also reflected changes to that cost when the user edited their quote.
	-Six Part Assignment: The concepts demonstrated in this app were various loop types (for loop, while loop, foreach loop) that incremented through arrays and lists, as well as
		pulling certain data based on specified conditions.
	-Lambda Expression Assignment: This assignment demonstrates the use of Lambda expressions to sort through a list, using conditions to pull certain data and add that to a new list.
	-Final Challenge Assignment: This app was created in order to utizile the Entity Framework and use Code-First to create a table within a database and add an entity to it.
